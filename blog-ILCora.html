                    <h1>Intern Letter: Cora Abrams-McCabe</h1>
                    <p>Hi!</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Cora and I started my Pure Mentorship Internship journey in December 2022. Although the internship was originally only intended for winter, I have continued my role into the present.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a Pure Mentorship intern I have been able to expand my skills and experience while maintaining a flexible schedule. As an Operations and Program Management Intern I’ve gained valuable experience using project management software, creating and adapting forms and processes, as well as working in a professional environment. The collaborative environment at Pure Mentorship has allowed me to gain new insight into other areas of work, and the flexible organization has allowed me to manage my academic, personal, and professional work in a way that works for me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Outside of my work at Pure Mentorship I am a student at San Jose State University majoring in aerospace engineering with minors in astrophysics and dance. I became interested in program management when a highschool teacher suggested I look into it because of all the planning I was doing both for academic teamwork and club work. Pure Mentorship’s focus on STEM, and my roles focus on organizational leadership are what drew me to the internship program.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>STEM, leadership, and dance have always been major aspects of my life. I am extremely grateful that Pure Mentorship embraces my different interests, thus allowing me to explore all of them, while gaining leadership and professional experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We are excited to welcome our second cohort of interns to Pure Mentorship for Summer 2023, and expand our roles. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hope to meet you soon!</p>
                    <p>Cora Abrams-McCabe</p>
