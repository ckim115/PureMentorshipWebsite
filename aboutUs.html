        <p>"Hello! My name is Thenu and I am a nationally-recognized 
            leader and the founder of Pure Mentorship! I strongly believe in the potential of 
            each individual and know that support from a mentor at a young age can propel 
            them toward a lifetime of success. I created Pure Mentorship and the mission 
            is simple. We bring together successful and well-rounded mentors and mentees
            who are seeking help in various areas of their lives whether they are in high school, 
            early college, or early career. We are based out of San Jose, CA and our mentors 
            come from all over the United States.Our mentors are working in various fields including 
            marketing, aerospace, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and computer science. 
            They come from schools just like yours and are pursuing higher education at local 
            universities as well as ivy league colleges. Now they are working at companies such 
            as Lockheed Martin Space, Amazon, Palo Alto Networks, NVIDIA, or their own startup! 
            They are passionate about supporting youth individuals through their goals no matter 
            how big or how small."</p>
