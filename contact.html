                <br>
                <p>Mentors are paired with a mentee based on their schedule and are 
                    required to meet with their mentee at least biweekly for an hour 
                    over the course of 1 year.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">How will a mentee get matched to the right mentor?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Each mentee and mentor meets with the founder in order to gain a 
                    thorough understanding of their profiles and where help is needed. Each pairing is made based off compatibility and interests to ensure the mentee is getting the right support & resources from the right person.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What is the internship program like?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Each intern designs their own experience by deciding what project 
                    they will work on and what skills they will employ. Interns 
                    may choose to continue with the team after a successful completion 
                    of their intern term. All interns work very closely with the 
                    founder for their projects and have lots of autonomy to create and deliver.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">How does mentorship benefit young students?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We encourage students to succeed in school. “A vast majority of 
                    educators — 95 % — say every student can benefit from having a 
                    one-on-one mentor, according to a recent survey of 1,418 grade 
                    4-12 teachers from nonprofit Gradient Learning. Additionally, 
                    82% said mentoring improves academic outcomes, and 83% said it 
                    helps students learn skills that support success” - K12Dive</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>We give students the confidence to achieve in their careers. 
                    “Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations 
                    found that mentoring programs boosted minority representation 
                    at the management level by 9% to 24% (compared to -2% to 18% 
                    with other diversity initiatives). The same study found that 
                    mentoring programs also dramatically improved promotion and 
                    retention rates for minorities and women—15% to 38% as compared
                     to non-mentored employees.” - Mentor Resources</p>
