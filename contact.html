            <button class="collapsible">What is the time commitment needed to be a mentor?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Mentors are paired with a mentee based on their schedule and are required to meet with their mentee at least biweekly for an hour over the course of 1 year.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">How will a mentee get matched to the right mentor?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Each mentee and mentor meets with the founder in order to gain a thorough understanding of their profiles and where help is needed. Each pairing is made based off compatibility and interests to ensure the mentee is getting the right support & resources from the right person.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What is the internship program like?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Each intern designs their own experience by deciding what project they will work on and what skills they will employ. Interns may choose to continue with the team after a successful completion of their intern term. All interns work very closely with the founder for their projects and have lots of autonomy to create and deliver.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">How does mentorship benefit young students?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We encourage students to succeed in school. “A vast majority of educators — 95 % — say every student can benefit from having a one-on-one mentor, according to a recent survey of 1,418 grade 4-12 teachers from nonprofit Gradient Learning. Additionally, 82% said mentoring improves academic outcomes, and 83% said it helps students learn skills that support success” - K12Dive</p>

            <button class="collapsible">How does mentorship benefit young professionals?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We give students the confidence to achieve in their careers. “Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations found that mentoring programs boosted minority representation at the management level by 9% to 24% (compared to -2% to 18% with other diversity initiatives). The same study found that mentoring programs also dramatically improved promotion and retention rates for minorities and women—15% to 38% as compared to non-mentored employees.” - Mentor Resources</p>
