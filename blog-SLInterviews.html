                    <h1>Student Leader Interviews</h1>
                    <p>Now as there is a week left before our Summer Student Leaders Cohort 
                        leave the Pure Mentorship Program, we would like to announce our 
                        appreciation for their contributions and hard work to our organizations 
                        goals. We have interviewed <strong>Raman Setty</strong>, <strong>Ananya Nayak</strong>, 
                        <strong>Advi Wehzan</strong>, <strong>Aryahvishwa Babu</strong> and 
                        <strong>Akhilesh Devamadhavan</strong> for their thoughts regarding the 
                        time they have spent here.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>The main task of Student Leaders is to organize and perform outreach 
                        events that will encourage other mentees and mentors to join our 
                        organizations. For many of our Student Leaders, according to the 
                        interviews we’ve conducted with them, this was the task that has given 
                        them the most memorable experience of taking responsibility for the 
                        organization of an event, collaborating with their fellow student 
                        leaders and interns, meeting and networking with completely new people. 
                        Not only has this event proven to bring new additions to PM, but also 
                        give valuable connections to our Student Leaders.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Raman Setty, with his aspirations to do business in the future leaning 
                        towards marketing and finance, has focused on advertisement of projects 
                        that will attract more people to Pure Mentorship. He has produced the 
                        Individualized Growth Plan(IGP) document for joining Mentee’s to fill 
                        out, not only to make matching with Mentors a smoother process, but to 
                        have a clearer mind in what their options can be. In his words, “Pure 
                        Mentorship is a place where you, at a young age, get the chance to 
                        expand your communication skills and have hands-on experience in 
                        business management as you get involved in the process of how a 
                        non-profit organization runs.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ananya Nayak, involved in social media and digital marketing in 
                        Pure Mentorship constructs videos for our website. In the future she 
                        looks forward to study both psychology and marketing, a combination of 
                        fields that is certain to prove formidable. Originally, she had 
                        joined Pure Mentorship as a mentee before taking on the role as one of 
                        our Student Leaders. In her words, “Public relations and marketing can 
                        be super helpful no matter what field you’re going into and these are 
                        the valuable experiences Pure Mentorship has to offer.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Advi Wehzan, who has helped Pure Mentorship in operations via 
                        collaborating with our IT team, and has plans to focus on Computer 
                        Science in his future. He joined Pure Mentorship to get practical 
                        experience regarding the real world and has helped with Outreach since. 
                        He expressed his admiration for how Pure Mentorship has managed to 
                        progress as a non-profit organization in the four weeks he has joined. 
                        In his words, “There are a lot of things in these world that you hadn’t 
                        had the chance to try, if you have career aspirations, Pure 
                        Mentorship is able to uniquely offer that for free.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Aryahvishwa Babu, aspiring to gain a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science 
                        in the future, is responsible for the modifications to the current website 
                        that we have and has shown remarkable usage of both technology and 
                        communication platforms to fulfill his responsibilities. In the future 
                        he will be in charge of the development and creation of Pure 
                        Mentorship’s new website. He expressed his excitement at being able to 
                        see the results of his own efforts in the time he has spent here. In 
                        his words, “I would recommend Pure Mentorship for how it connects you 
                        to experienced Mentors that can provide guidance and support, and how 
                        the process of joining the program is both simple and free. The given 
                        timeline is 3 months and you’re able to either extend or drop off sooner.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Akhilesh Devamadhavan, in charge of the expansion of Pure Mentorship by 
                        helping in organization, operations and the IT team has plans that 
                        involve engineering and computer science for his future, and apply to 
                        more positions at Pure Mentorship, taking on larger roles such as 
                        Management to further help our organization. During the time he spent 
                        in Pure Mentorship, he’s had the chance to learn how people work 
                        together in a professional sense. In his words,  “Without Pure 
                        Mentorship, it would be hard for for people to grow and become the 
                        best possible version they want to be.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our mentorship program aims towards ensuring that opportunities will 
                        be available and free for the underprivileged, by providing 
                        connections and practical experiences through our Mentors.</p>
