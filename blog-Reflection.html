                    <h1>A Reflection of the New Changes with Thenu</h1>
                    <p>From the founding of Pure Mentorship to where Pure Mentorship is now, Thenu Senthil has led a team of two to a team of 20. I was lucky enough to interview Thenu about the recent additions to Pure Mentorship.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>When Pure Mentorship first started, Thenu had recruited Vienna and Cora–the Interim Director and Operations Lead. As it’s grown, I asked Thenu how she felt about the new changes throughout the summer.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>“I think that when things are meant to be, you never really over think it,” she said, “I feel really peaceful overseeing a team of, now, 20 people when it used to be 2.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Even though there is a clear difference in managing a small and large team, Thenu has made sure to talk to Vienna and Cora as their “abilities to work together and play to each other’s strengths”  made the transition less stressful.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Communication has become a bigger emphasis due to working with a remote team. Thenu does her best to understand the unique situation that every intern and student leader goes through. In order to help build the team she states that it is important to, “Put people and their individuality over the bottom line, so while I can force everyone to adhere to my communication and work style, I first learn theirs and work from there.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the end of the day, she feels rewarded to “watch every intern grown and find a sense of accomplishment and make them feel like their own leader.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a last question, I asked her what she wanted Pure Mentorship to be known as.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>“Pure Mentorship is always growing–there are so many ways to grow and improve as a team. It’s an ever evolving program. I want everyone to get from point A to Point B.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>She ends our interview with the powerful, “I want Pure Mentorship to be the gateway to their dream future.”</p>
