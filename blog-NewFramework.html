                    <h1>Our New Framework</h1>
                    <p>Pure Mentorship focuses on making sure that we improve and help students find the mentor that they need.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>Mentorship can look different for everyone–in many cases, it can be extremely beneficial for many people. Yet, finding the correct mentor can be extremely difficult for students. Pure Mentorship wants to ease the gap and connect students to a mentor that fits their needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One major change that Pure Mentorship is making in order to make mentorship more accessible is their choice in framework or not.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Instead of having one way to have meetings and goal setting, we are leaving it up to the mentee to choose whether or not they want to use the current framework.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The current framework, commonly known as the IGP (Individual Growth Plan), is a great way for mentees who want more structure. The IGP focuses on creating SMART goals in order to encourage growth in the following areas: academic, personal, and professional. Both mentors and mentees can use the IGP framework and set these SMART goals as a way to structure growth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>SMART goals focus on creating attainable goals in a timely manner. The different aspects of SMART stand for: Specific, Meansurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time Bound.</p>
                    <p>For mentees who don’t want to use the IGP, they are welcome to talk to Thenu, our founder, about what they want from their mentors.</p>
                    <br>
