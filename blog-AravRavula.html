                    <h1>Intern Letter: Arav Ravula</h1>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Arav Ravula and I started my internship with Pure 
                        Mentorship just over a month ago. I’m currently a rising senior and 
                        part of the IT intern Team. I enjoy playing basketball, watching 
                        movies, coding, learning new things, and generally being a curious person. I learned about Pure Mentorship through LinkedIn and it immediately struck me as a great opportunity. I chose to work for Pure Mentorship to join a collaborative environment where I could learn from others and continue building my skills, all while contributing to a meaningful cause.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>As a member of the IT team, programming is much more than simply writing 
                        code. It involves various aspects, such as planning, developing, 
                        debugging, and more. My coding journey began with watching online 
                        tutorials, building personal projects, and taking courses offered at my 
                        school. I find programming to be an enriching and rewarding process, 
                        where I can take a vision or idea and carefully develop it into a 
                        tangible product.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During my time at Pure Mentorship, I had the opportunity to work on both 
                        the old and new websites. While the old website allowed me to ease into 
                        the new environment and get to know my team members, the majority of 
                        our growth as a team came through working on the new website. We faced 
                        unique and unexpected challenges including not being able to 
                        communicate properly due to all of us working from remote locations. 
                        One way I navigated this issue was by talking to Thenu and Vienna so 
                        we could understand the root cause of the issue and address it. The IT 
                        team found new ways to hold each other accountable and soon started 
                        becoming more efficient.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Being the youngest member of the IT team, I initially came into this 
                        position assuming I would be looking to everyone else for direction and 
                        guidance. However, this experience quickly transformed my perception of 
                        leadership. “Leadership” doesn’t necessarily mean there’s one person in 
                        charge of the group. Instead, each member of a group can be a leader in 
                        their own way. I learned that being a leader means taking initiative, 
                        reaching out to others, and even asking for help when I need it. 
                        Everyone here at Pure Mentorship wants everyone else to succeed and I 
                        think that is a really important value to have.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Implementing Peer Mentorship into my own community would  include 
                        bringing awareness to the concept of mentorship. Many individuals don’t 
                        understand the value of having a mentor, and I believe it is important 
                        to encourage an open-minded approach towards mentorship. Also, many 
                        mentees eventually go on to become mentors themselves and this cycle of 
                        mentorship creates a continuous and enriching experience for future 
                        generations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All in all, this internship was a remarkable learning experience for me, 
                        both in terms of growing my technical skills as well as growing my 
                        social skills. I hope this letter provides a bit of insight into what 
                        this experience meant to me and I hope you are all able to take 
                        something positive from it!</p>
